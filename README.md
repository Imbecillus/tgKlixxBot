tgKlixxBot is a C# program which uses the Telegram API to enable playing live with "Verflixxte Klixx" on Rocket Beans TV. Feel free to drop in when it's Thursday yet again: @KlixxChat.

For it to run, you'll need:
 - Newtonsoft.Json 12.0.2
 - RestSharp 106.6.9

In the directory you compile tgKlixxBot into, you'll need two files:
 - kronenliste.json, where tgKlixxBot saves the highscore list.
 - botcode.txt, a text file containing the Telegram API code.
